# Kozijnr

Monorepo containing:

- `api/` — backend, Symfony (PHP 8.5)
- `web/` — frontend, Next.js (Node 24, latest stable LTS)
- `docker/` — Dockerfiles for the local dev environment
- `docker-compose.yml` — orchestrates backend, frontend and database for local development
- `Makefile` — thin wrappers around the `docker compose` commands below

## Requirements

- Docker Desktop (or an equivalent Docker Engine + Compose v2 install)

Nothing else needs to be installed on the host — PHP, Composer, Node and npm all run inside the containers.

## Quick start

```bash
make up
```

This builds the images (first run only) and starts everything in the background:

- Frontend (Next.js): http://localhost:3000
- Backend (Symfony): http://localhost:8000 — health check at http://localhost:8000/api/health
- Database (PostgreSQL 16): localhost:5432 (user `app`, password `app`, database `app`)

Follow logs with:

```bash
make logs
```

Stop everything with:

```bash
make down
```

## Make targets

| Target | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `make up` | Start the stack in the background (builds images if needed) |
| `make down` | Stop and remove the stack's containers |
| `make build` | Build (or rebuild) all images |
| `make rebuild` | Rebuild images from scratch and restart the stack |
| `make restart` | Restart all services |
| `make logs` | Tail logs for all services |
| `make ps` | Show status of the stack's containers |
| `make sh-backend` | Open a shell in the backend container |
| `make sh-frontend` | Open a shell in the frontend container |
| `make composer args="require foo/bar"` | Run a composer command in the backend container |
| `make console args="cache:clear"` | Run a `bin/console` command in the backend container |
| `make npm args="run lint"` | Run an npm command in the frontend container |

These are thin wrappers around `docker compose` — nothing here does more than the
target's one-line `docker compose ...` invocation, see the `Makefile` itself.

## Development workflow

- Both `api/` and `web/` are bind-mounted into their containers, so editing code on the
  host is picked up live:
  - Backend: PHP's built-in server (`php -S`) re-evaluates PHP files on every request — no restart needed.
  - Frontend: Next.js dev server hot-reloads on file changes.
- Dependencies (`vendor/` for the backend, `node_modules/` for the frontend) live in
  named Docker volumes rather than being bind-mounted from the host. This means:
  - You don't need PHP/Composer or Node/npm installed locally at all.
  - Running `composer require ...` or `npm install ...` should be done *inside* the
    container (`make composer args="require ..."` / `make sh-frontend` then `npm install ...`)
    so the lockfile and the container's dependency volume stay in sync.
  - If you change `composer.lock` or `package-lock.json` from the host (e.g. after a
    `git pull`), run `make rebuild` (or just restart the affected service) so the
    entrypoint script reinstalls dependencies.

## Versions

- PHP: **8.5** (pinned in `docker/backend/Dockerfile`, image `php:8.5-cli-alpine`)
- Node: **24** (pinned in `docker/frontend/Dockerfile`, image `node:24-alpine` — latest stable LTS as of this writing)
- PostgreSQL: **16** (`postgres:16-alpine`)

These versions are pinned explicitly and won't silently move forward with new releases —
bump them deliberately in the relevant Dockerfile when needed.

## Out of scope

This setup covers the local development environment only. Production deployment and
CI/CD configuration are handled separately.
